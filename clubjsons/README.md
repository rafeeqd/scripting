## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the Prerequisites section.

2. Clone the repository or download the script file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Modify the `path_to_json` variable in the script to specify the path to the directory containing the JSON files.

5. Modify the `output_file` variable in the script to specify the name of the output Excel file.

6. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
